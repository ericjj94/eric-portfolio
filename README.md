The application is a description of who I am and what I do. The applications contains details of the projects I have worked on.The portfolio is under development.

# Technology Stack

The portfolio has been developed using ReactJS and uses ExpressJS to render the production build, Since the content is very static, there's no database associated with it. The application also uses styled-components to use the concepts of CSS-in-JS(only a few components use styled-components).

## Setup the application locally for development environment

1. `npm i` in the root folder would install all the required dependencies required to run the project
2. cd eric-portfolio
3. Start the development build by running the command `npm run start:dev`

## Run the production build

To create a production build,

1. `npm run build`
2. to start the production build locally: `npm run start`

## Note:

The message section is not implemented. The UI component has been implemented but there is no interaction with the backend.
